# Hu Tao Damage Comparision
Damage comparision for hutao with various artifacts, weapons and conditions

# IMPORTANT

There were several assumptions made with this project, mainly regarding hu tao's exact stats. I decided to arbitrarily enter stats that i felt were reasonable but if you want to personalize this, I recommend editing main.py under mainfolder. I'm 99% sure my formulas and understanding of game mechanics is correct but if you see any mistakes I made feel free to open an issue. 

Hu Tao will throughout try to use the N1C1 jump cancel combo, which approximately takes half a second. When stamina is low, switch to normal attacking. 1 energy is gained per second, which might seem too arbitrary but this almost doesn't matter at all as the only stat it affects is that of the artifacts(which I will address in the tl;dr)

For vaporize comparisions, vape is considered to happen only during skill and happens every other second.

For most fights, time for dealing damage is considered to be 3 minutes. Fights where crit needs to be considered have been extended to 30 minutes to mostly eliminate the random factor.

Hu Tao is always considered to be below 50% hp but that is what you should be going for anyways

# TL;DR

- 4 star weapons - Blackcliff Pole all the way if you have high crit rate. Deathmatch for boss fights. Blackcliff or Deathmatch(not f2p tho) if you have lower crit rate. Dragon's Bane is ok but not great. Use only if you don't have the others.

- Artifacts - For general use, SR(shimenawa's reminiscence) and CWF(crimson witch of flames) are both pretty much equal. Use whichever you have better substats for. For more specifc, CWF is better for shorter fights, SR for longer fights. CWF better for vaporize comps.

- C1 vs Staff of Homa - Staff of Homa deals more damage. But keep in mind that c1 hu tao is much easier to get than staff of homa because of the mechanics of featured character banners vs featured weapon banners. If you already have staff of homa, c1 is still a very solid investment
